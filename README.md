**Date-Formatter**

**Overview:**
The Date-Formatter project is a simple web application that allows users to view the current date in different formats based on their preferences. It leverages the JavaScript `Date` object and provides a user-friendly interface to choose between various date display options.

**Key Features:**
1. **Current Date Display:** The application prominently showcases today's date at the top of the page.
2. **Date Format Options:** Users can select from three different date format options:
   - **Day, Month, Year (`dd-mm-yyyy`):** The default format.
   - **Year, Month, Day (`yyyy-mm-dd`):** Rearranges the date components.
   - **Month, Day, Year, Hours, Minutes (`mm-dd-yyyy-h-mm`):** Includes additional time information.
3. **Dynamic Update:** The displayed date updates dynamically as the user selects different format options.

**Code Structure:**
- The JavaScript (`script.js`) handles date formatting logic and updates the HTML content based on user interactions.
- The HTML (`index.html`) provides the structure of the web page, including a dropdown for selecting date formats and a container for displaying the current date.
- The CSS (`styles.css`) ensures a visually appealing and responsive layout, with a dark theme and yellow accents.

**How to Use:**
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Choose a date format from the dropdown menu.
3. Observe the dynamically updated date displayed below the dropdown.

**Design Highlights:**
- The project features a clean and modern design with a dark color scheme and yellow accents.
- The dropdown menu is styled for a seamless user experience, and a small icon indicates the dropdown's purpose.

**Responsiveness:**
The design is responsive, adapting to smaller screens with adjusted font sizes and layout modifications to enhance usability on mobile devices.

**Dependencies:**
The project relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or frameworks are used.
